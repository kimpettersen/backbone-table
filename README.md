Notes:
======

I assumed that the values would be Numbers, so I made the sorting work for numbers.
 You can add whatever value you want though, it just wont be sorted.
 
I have used calls instead of triggering events, exept with the rendering. It doesn't matter right now,
but I guess it might be better to use events in a pub/sub pattern when the application grows.

I did not write unit tests yet.
